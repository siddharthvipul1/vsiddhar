        "body": " Context Celebrating Fedora Release Party is now a custom in Bangalore. This time, although late, we organized it in Red Hat Banglaore Engineering office. We were expecting 30 people to attend the party and we received a fairly good response with ~25 people on and off. Some came for SilverBlue, some to install Fedora 30 and some wanted to know more about the 31 changesets. It was a rather successful event considering it was a working day AND RootConf was at the same $day:time on a different part of city. People love RootConf.\nWhat happened in the celebration  I started the event by discussing talking points of Fedora 30. When I reached changes in security, questions started coming it. Thankfully we had a Gluster Engineer who works a lot around libcrypt and he was able to drive the discussion into a very productive one.\n Sinny spoke and showed demo of SilverBlue. We had so many question it lasted for an hour.\n [Anuj] and I discussed Fedora Summer Coding programs and did an unofficial call for mentors in case there is something that they wish for Fedora and want to make it a success by taking it on their own. :P (focus on unofficial)\n  Thanks to Bex for sending us a good amount of Swag that made the participants (and me :P) super happy. Followed by swag distribution, we cut the cake (cut by a user who has promised that he will contribute the package he is facing issues into by doing update testing). Cake, Swag and cherry on top we had burgers for everyone. It was an wonderful and a successful event.\nPost food and networking, I showed how to test packages to Digganta (The guy who cut the cake). We called off the event by 06:00 pm. A good 4 hours of users/contributions meeting was amazing to see!\nThanks to all the participants, and Red Hat Bangalore site managers to provide us the venue and snacks.\nSumantro was missed.\nA rather short report, now enjoy some pictures here\n"

        "body": " WOW! What an experience it was to meet all the people I have been knowing through IRC..faceless people with random nick that has nothing to do with their name.. but brilliant minds who make a very open, inclusive, welcoming and a powerful project possible!\n This was my first Flock and It has been the best conference/event I have ever attended.\n Unlike other conferences where there are a lot of people presenting their own project and are distributed in groups, everyone in the Flock was connected to a single string, Fedora!\nread for a brief summary of the event.\nWhere? Radisson Blu, Radebeul - Dresden | Germany\nWhen? During the hottest time in whole Europe (which is not very bad)\nAugust 7th to August 11th\nA bit about the talks and presentations Keynote \u0026lsquo;State of Fedora (Objectives \u0026amp; Editions)\u0026rsquo; started at 9\u0026rsquo;o clock in which Matthew Miller, Brian Exelbierd, Stephen Gallagher, Dusty Mabe, Peter Robinson and Langdon White presented * stats, successes, ups, and downs of the Fedora Project. * About Flock and it\u0026rsquo;s value. * About SIGs * where as a community we stand and the areas we need to improve.\nCombined, a very insightful and informative presentation.\nI tried to attend as many talks/workshops as possible still keeping some time in hand to meet those amazing people in person and discuss a few ideas (or at least share a handshake). Every talk was full of discussion. The Attendees were not just there to listen and take notes, but to provide their input which I have never seen anywhere else. So many planning meetings, SIGs gathering and a lot of snacks during the tea break (thanks ARM for sponsoring it) made it a perfect event.\nMy schedule: https://flock2018.sched.com/siddharthvipul1\nOther stuff Flock didn\u0026rsquo;t just involved talks and knowledge sharing, but also candies. Credit goes to Justin for organizing the International candy swap event. Everyone brought what they thought authentic and local from their country including some weird ones to have fun. well, the weird credit goes to Göran and me. TBH what I took (Pulse candy) was not really weird, but like Indians, not everyone likes spices in their candy. Oh wait, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the candy that Göran brought wasn\u0026rsquo;t weird\u0026hellip; It was scary! But that\u0026rsquo;s what made the event even more memorable. We had a lot of fun making people try it and waiting for their reaction.\nAmazing Dominika Bula had organised a scavenzer hunt for us which was designed to make us explore the city center .\nThen we went to Roller Coaster Restaurant which was different, thus awesome! Other fun things like game night, karaoke event, and eating everyday out with others, going for a walk in a biiiig group, laughing and enjoying (/me cries and gets nostalgic)\nIt was an experience that no one can say no to. I am definfitly loolking forward to attend more of such events.\n Thank you Fedora for sponsoring my trip :)\n "

Sadly, this changes now. I have decided to manage this colorless website (Hugo+Coder, as it requires ~no effort). If I am alive and in right sense, I will be putting at least one post every week month.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a small/slow target but for now let\u0026rsquo;s not promise the mountain. Ideally, I should have migrated my previous blogs, but they are full of color and also don\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. I have recently (very recently) joined Fedora Core Engineering (Platform Team) and will be working on CentOS CI, Fedora CI and a bit of other stuff which I haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out yet.\nMost probably this will be updates of my work, few exciting news or small reads/interesting knowledge sharing platform.\nSo, keep in touch, I might add some way of notifying people (no promises) or I might just keep it as my diary (open).\nA formal ending with a formal Thank you!\n"
