<h1 id="wow">WOW!</h1>

<p>What an experience it was to meet all the people I have been knowing
through IRC..faceless people with random nick that has nothing to do with
their name.. but brilliant minds who make a very open, inclusive, welcoming
and a powerful project possible!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first Flock and It has been the best conference/event I have ever attended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike other conferences where there are a lot of people presenting their own
project and are distributed in groups, everyone in the Flock was connected to a
single string, Fedora!</p>

<p>read for a brief summary of the event.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="where">Where?</h3>

<p>Radisson Blu,
<strong>Radebeul - Dresden</strong> | Germany</p>

<h3 id="when">When?</h3>

<p>During the hottest time in whole Europe (which is not very bad)</p>

<p><strong>August 7th</strong> to <strong>August 11th</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-bit-about-the-talks-and-presentations">A bit about the talks and presentations</h2>

<p>Keynote &lsquo;State of Fedora (Objectives &amp; Editions)&rsquo;
started at 9&rsquo;o clock in which <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mattdm">Matthew
Miller</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bex">Brian
Exelbierd</a>,
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sgallagh">Stephen Gallagher</a>, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Dustymabe">Dusty Mabe</a>,
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pbrobinson">Peter Robinson</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Langdon">Langdon White</a>
presented
 * stats, successes, ups, and downs of the Fedora Project.
 * About Flock and it&rsquo;s value.
 * About SIGs
 * where as a community we stand and the areas we need to improve.</p>

<p>Combined, a very insightful and informative presentation.</p>

<p>I tried to attend as many talks/workshops as possible still keeping some time
in hand to meet those amazing people in person and discuss a few ideas (or at
least share a handshake).
Every talk was full of discussion. The Attendees
were not just there to listen and take notes, but to provide their input which
I have never seen anywhere else.
So many planning meetings, SIGs gathering and a lot of snacks during the tea
break (thanks ARM for sponsoring it) made it a perfect event.</p>

<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>

<p>Flock didn&rsquo;t just involved talks and knowledge sharing, but also candies.
Credit goes to Justin for organizing the International candy swap event.
Everyone brought what they thought authentic and local from their country
including some weird ones to have fun. well,
the weird credit goes to Göran and me. TBH what I took (Pulse candy) was
not really weird, but like Indians, not everyone likes spices in their candy.
Oh wait, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the candy that Göran brought wasn&rsquo;t weird&hellip; It
was scary! But that&rsquo;s what made the event even more memorable. We had a lot of
fun making people try it and waiting for their reaction.</p>

<p>Amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/DomiBula">Dominika Bula</a> had organised a scavenzer hunt for us which was
designed to make us explore the city center .</p>

<p>Then we went to Roller Coaster Restaurant which was different, thus awesome!
Other fun things like game night, karaoke event, and eating everyday out with
others, going for a walk in a biiiig group, laughing and enjoying (/me cries
and gets nostalgic)</p>

<p>It was an experience that no one can say no to. I am definfitly loolking
forward to attend more of such events.</p>
