<p>Celebrating Fedora Release Party is now a custom in Bangalore. This time,
although late, we organized it in Red Hat Banglaore Engineering office. We were
expecting 30 people to attend the party and we received a fairly good response
with ~25 people on and off. Some came for SilverBlue, some to install Fedora
30 and some wanted to know more about the 31 changesets. It was a rather
successful event considering it was a working day AND <strong>RootConf</strong> was at the same <code>$day:time</code> on a
different part of city. People love RootConf.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I started the event by discussing <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_30_talking_points">talking points</a> of Fedora 30.
When I reached changes in security, questions started coming it. Thankfully we
had a Gluster Engineer who works a lot around libcrypt and he was able to drive
the discussion into a very productive one.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sinnykumari">Sinny</a> spoke and showed demo of SilverBlue. We had so many question it
lasted for an hour.</p></li>

<li><p>[Anuj] and I discussed Fedora Summer Coding programs and did an unofficial
call for mentors in case there is something that they wish for Fedora and
want to make it a success by taking it on their own. :P (focus on unofficial)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Bex">Bex</a> for sending us a good amount of Swag that made the participants
(and me :P) super happy. Followed by swag distribution, we cut the cake (cut by a user who has promised that he will contribute the
package he is facing issues into by doing update testing).
Cake, Swag and cherry on top we had burgers for everyone. It was an wonderful
and a successful event.</p>

<p>Post food and networking, I showed how to test packages to Digganta (The guy
who cut the cake).
We called off the event by 06:00 pm. A good 4 hours of users/contributions
meeting was amazing to see!</p>

<p>Thanks to all the participants, and Red Hat Bangalore site managers to  provide
us the venue and snacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Sumantrom">Sumantro</a> was missed.</p>

<p>A rather short report, now enjoy some pictures <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Lnr78rGmLXiqTBzB9">here</a></p>
