      <description>Context Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, 8,108 students from 107 countries have completed over 40,100 open source tasks Because Google Code-in is often the first experience many students have with open source, the contest is designed to make it easy for students to jump right in. I was one of the mentors in this first time for Fedora program.</description>

      <description>Context Celebrating Fedora Release Party is now a custom in Bangalore. This time, although late, we organized it in Red Hat Banglaore Engineering office. We were expecting 30 people to attend the party and we received a fairly good response with ~25 people on and off. Some came for SilverBlue, some to install Fedora 30 and some wanted to know more about the 31 changesets. It was a rather successful event considering it was a working day AND RootConf was at the same $day:time on a different part of city.</description>

      <description>WOW! What an experience it was to meet all the people I have been knowing through IRC..faceless people with random nick that has nothing to do with their name.. but brilliant minds who make a very open, inclusive, welcoming and a powerful project possible!
 This was my first Flock and It has been the best conference/event I have ever attended.
 Unlike other conferences where there are a lot of people presenting their own project and are distributed in groups, everyone in the Flock was connected to a single string, Fedora!</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss vsiddhar.me I have been suggested multiple time to manage a blog, share my stories, events and ideas, but as being a &amp;lsquo;Pro&amp;rsquo; procrastinator, I haven&amp;rsquo;t run from my responsibilities and thus, haven&amp;rsquo;t done the right thing! Sadly, this changes now. I have decided to manage this colorless website (Hugo+Coder, as it requires ~no effort). If I am alive and in right sense, I will be putting at least one post every week month.</description>
