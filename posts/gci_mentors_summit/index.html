<p>Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17)
to open source software development. Since 2010, 8,108 students from 107
countries have completed over 40,100 open source tasks Because Google Code-in
is often the first experience many students have with
open source, the contest is designed to make it easy for students to jump right
in.
I was one of the mentors in this first time for Fedora program. We had 125 students participating in Fedora and the top 3 students completed 26, 25 and 22 tasks each.</p>
