      <description>WOW! What an experience it was to meet all the people I have been knowing through IRC..faceless people with random nick that has nothing to do with their name.. but brilliant minds who make a very open, inclusive, welcoming and a powerful project possible!
 This was my first Flock and It has been the best conference/event I have ever attended.
 Unlike other conferences where there are a lot of people presenting their own project and are distributed in groups, everyone in the Flock was connected to a single string, Fedora!</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss vsiddhar.me I have been suggested multiple time to manage a blog, share my stories, events and ideas, but as being a &amp;lsquo;Pro&amp;rsquo; procrastinator, I haven&amp;rsquo;t run from my responsibilities and thus, haven&amp;rsquo;t done the right thing! Sadly, this changes now. I have decided to manage this colorless website (Hugo+Coder, as it requires ~no effort). If I am alive and in right sense, I will be putting at least one post every week month.</description>
